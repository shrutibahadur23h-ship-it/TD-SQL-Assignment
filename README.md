# TD-SQL Assignment

**Project Synopsis**
The goal of the project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of foundational SQL concepts—including Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Query Language (DQL)—and show how they're applied in real-world business scenarios. By completing the assigned  tasks, we will gain practical experience in data generation, validation, and comparison, equipping you with essential skills for an end-to-end data workflow.
The document outlines a hands-on, end-to-end data handling project focused on SQL. Using direct SQL scripts in a MySQL 8.3.4 environment, the project walks  through key tasks such as generating random data, identifying and processing duplicate records, and comparing data across different feeds.

**System Requirements**-To complete the assignment, we have used the following:
Database Server: MySQL version 8.3.0 or a compatible version.
Client Tool: Any standard SQL client is suitable, such as MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or an online SQL compiler.
